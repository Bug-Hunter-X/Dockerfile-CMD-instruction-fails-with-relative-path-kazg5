This repository contains a Dockerfile that demonstrates a common error when using the CMD instruction with a relative path to an application script. The issue arises when the script's location is not explicitly defined within the Dockerfile, leading to a failure during the container startup process. The provided solution demonstrates how to rectify this issue by using an absolute path to the application script, guaranteeing that the script's location is correctly specified within the Dockerfile, ensuring successful container startup and application execution.
